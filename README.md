# 🛒 Olist Ecommerce ETL Pipeline & GTM Analysis

## 🧭 Executive Summary 
<p>
A friend who works as a manager at <b>Olist</b> shared their marketplace data with me. <b>I noticed</b> inconsistencies and gaps in order volumes, high cancellation rates, and unclear patterns in repeat buyers, which made it difficult to understand marketplace performance. 

To address this, I analyzed the data focusing on GMV (Gross Merchandise Value), order volume, cancellations, and repeat buyers. This analysis highlights top-performing sellers, revenue-driving product categories, and patterns in customer behavior, providing actionable insights to guide business decisions and improve operational efficiency.

### ❓ Research Question
<p>
  How is the e-commerce marketplace performing over time in terms of GMV, order volume, cancellations, and repeat buyers?”
</p>

### 💼 Business Problem
<p>
Olist marketplace wanted to understand trends in order volumes, cancellations, and repeat buyers over time, as these metrics affect revenue and customer retention. Without this insight, management cannot identify growth opportunities or operational challenges.
  
Specifically, they need to know:
<ul>
  <li> Which sellers and product categories drive the most GMV and revenue?</li>
  
  <li> How order volumes and cancellations are trending month-to-month?</li>
  
  <li> How repeat customers behave and which segments are most valuable?</li>
</ul

Answering these questions helps the business identify growth opportunities, reduce operational issues (like cancellations), and improve customer retention.

In short: "How can the marketplace increase revenue, reduce cancellations, and retain more customers?"

<h3>Architecture Diagram:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Upload timing significantly impacts performance, with specific <strong>days and afternoon time windows</strong> showing higher median views</li>
  <li>Technical topics such as <strong>SQL and Power BI</strong> achieved higher engagement rates</li>
  <li>Channels with fewer but <strong>strategically timed uploads</strong> often outperformed high-frequency uploaders</li>
  <li>Video duration and description length showed weak correlations, indicating <strong>content quality outweighs length</strong></li>
</ul>

<b>Conclusion:</b>
Early-stage data related YouTube channels gain faster traction by focusing on high-engagement, beginner-friendly topics such as SQL, and job-related content, while scheduling uploads early in the week-especially Monday afternoons. More advanced topics should be introduced later to sustain long-term growth once the channel has established an engaged audience.

## 📂 Deliverables
<ul>
  <li><strong>Power BI Dashboard</strong> - Interactive exploration of YouTube performance metrics</li>
